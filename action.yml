inputs:
  version:
    required: true
    description: A version to process
  compare-to:
    required: false
    description: A version to compare with, if any
  diff-with:
    required: false
    description: A version to diff with. If not specified, the version will be diffed with the `compare-to` input. If `compare-to` is not specified either, nothing happens.
  satisfies:
    required: false
    description: A range to check against
  identifier:
    required: false
    description: An identifier to pass to the semver's inc function
  lenient:
    required: false
    description: Do not fail on incorrect input
    default: 'true'
outputs:
  release:
    description: Version's release (major.minor.patch)
  major:
    description: Version's major number
  minor:
    description: Version's minor number
  patch:
    description: Version's patch number
  build:
    description: Version's build
  build-parts:
    description: Number of components in version's build. Individual сomponents are returned as `build-N` outputs, where an is an index from zero to `build-parts` - 1.
  prerelease:
    description: Version's pre-release
  prerelease-parts:
    description: Number of components in version's pre-release. Individual сomponents are returned as `prerelease-N` outputs, where an is an index from zero to `prerelease-parts` - 1.
  comparison-result:
    description: If the compare-to was provided, this output will contain "<" if comes after the version, ">" if it preceeds it, and "=" if they are equal
  diff-result:
    description: If the diff-to or compare-to were provided, this output will contain the diff result
  satisfies:
    description: true if the version satisfies the given range

  inc-minor:
    description: A result of the call of the semver's `inc` function with `minor` increment
  inc-preminor:
    description: A result of the call of the semver's `inc` function with `preminor` increment
  inc-patch:
    description: A result of the call of the semver's `inc` function with `patch` increment
  inc-prepatch:
    description: A result of the call of the semver's `inc` function with `prepatch` increment
